				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The making of careeverze. Please join me on an immersive journey as we dive deep into the
					nitty-gritty of building a web platform for career planning from a UX perspective.</p>

				<blockquote>To become â€œa compass in the world of work".</blockquote>

				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>We followed the classic double diamond model, but with an agile twist. We researched, analyzed,
					created and validated not just on a macro level but on a micro too. It's because we needed as much
					feedback from users and reality as often and as quickly as possible.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/methodology.png" alt=""></div>

				<h2>Core problem</h2>
				<p>Let's imagine you have just finished studying economics and realized that you want to do something
					different. You want to do something with product design. This may certainly sound like an extreme
					case but for a second let's play with the thought that this is really happening...</p>

				<p>"Millions of people have left their jobs in search of more fulfilling roles with greater flexibility,
					it's been called the Great Reshuffle." <i><a
							href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/great-reshuffle-jobs-market-resignation/"> -
							World
							Economic
							Forum</a></i></p>

				<p>To begin with your transition into Product Design, UX Design seems like a great place to start,
					right?</p>

				<p><i>But what is UX Design exactly? And where should I begin my journey with that?</i></p>


				<p>You google the questions and realize that even though the field of UX Design is barely a decade old,
					but somehow it has already expanded into this vast place with a myriad of opportunities. So you ask
					yourself even more questions...</p>

				<p><i>Should I work on information architecture? Or should I do something with animation design? Or
						maybe
						I should become a conversion rate optimization consultant, and fine tune the heck out of our
						landing
						page?</i></p>

				<p>These are only <i>some</i> of the questions you have to answer to <i>start</i> walking on your
					journey. And we still haven't even touched on long term career planning.</p>

				<p>There has to be a better way to plan smartly one of the most important aspects of one's life:
					<b>career</b>.
				</p>

				<blockquote>And so we decided to make career planning effective and transparent.</blockquote>

				</p>

				<h2>Competitor analysis</h2>
				<p>Initial research has proved that there is indeed a need for a career planning solution. There are
					currently platforms, individuals and companies who serve the career counsellor role but <b>none of
						the European players can connect you to your most fitting career options based on current job
						market conditions.</b></p>

				<p>Check out our <i><a
							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ttDbFne-rh4DLw8YQ2K93tfEpEZkhF3y_TJmz3QmD4/edit?usp=sharing">COMPETITOR
							ANALYSIS</a></i></p>

				<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
				<p>As a secondary school director in one of our expert interviews had promptly stated: <i>"In most
						cases,
						students will go on to do jobs that do not even exist today."</i> This sums up perfectly the
					current
					fast changing market conditions for which teachers, counselors and institutions are not prepared.
				</p>

				<h2>Secondary research</h2>
				<p>As much smarter people have said before us, Gen Z - our target userbase - is the latest generation to
					"just barely" enter the workforce. So there is limited research available on this cohort, and of
					limited quality.</p>

				<p><i>"All research around Gen Z currently focuses on students, making it challenging
						to predict their job-related behavior."</i> <i><a
							href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJTD-07-2020-0124/full/html">EMERALD
							INSIDE</a></i></p>

				<p>In addition, our research typically relies on US research, so Gen Z in Europe may be more nuanced
					than this.</p>

				<p>
				<ul><b>With that said, we can say that Generation Z is:</b>
					<li>Hypercognitive</li>
					<li>Hybrid</li>
					<li>Generalist</li>
					<li>Individualist</li>
					<li>Independent</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>And most importantly <b>career-oriented</b> (success-oriented).</p>

				<p>
				<ol><b>In order of importance to them in terms of career choice:</b>
					<li>Money</li>
					<li>Purpose</li>
					<li>Work-life balance</li>
					<li>More human (e.g.: the job role is focusing on human interactions)</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
				<ul><b>And their major challenges are:</b>
					<li>What career am I interested in?</li>
					<li>How can I tell what I'm good at or bad at?</li>
					<li>Anxiety</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Check out our <i><a
							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnOwuEtFlfBlD7Y-zOBF8kT7OePxOu-70qbjr3ROlJQ/edit?usp=sharing">SECONDARY
							RESEARCH_HU</a></i> where we dove deep into the relation between gen Z and career.</p>

				<h2>Expert interviews</h2>
				<p><b>The consensus among respondents is that career guidance in the traditional sense is bleeding from
						several wounds. Unpreparedness in public education, lack of interest on the part of students and
						under-informed guidance counselors all contribute to poor career choices.</b> Where parents are
					not
					aware of the labor market, students mostly turn to their teachers, who are often unable to provide
					adequate assistance, as few of them are qualified to do so. Therefore, they often start with the
					fact that what the child is good at is what the child should do, which is clearly wrong (e.g.: "you
					are good in chemics therefore you should be a doctor").</p>

				<p><b>Some of the emerging questions after the
						interviews</b></p>

				<p><i>Is there a need today for young people to be helped in their career choices? For those who do
						have a need, what tools do they use to find their way and how do they relate to them? Are any of
						those tools effective?</i></p>

				<p><i>Who is willing to pay for this information (e.g. parents, schools, school districts, state, etc.)
						aka do we have a "hidden" secondary user behind our target users (e.g. parents, teachers,
						counselors)?</i></p>

				<p><i>Is testing necessary to inform students' career choices in a meaningful way? (Testing could be
						e.g.: personality, IQ, soft skill, value, interest, etc.)</i></p>

				<p><i>Another important question is whether the product should be a browser interface to be explored or
						a more "directional" system?</i></p>

				<p><i>What are students' feelings about career choices? * How do students feel about career guidance in
						the classical sense (e.g. counseling)?</i></p>

				<p>Check out our <i><a
							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jftIdNkbyUimFTjZ-JniT93DZnoNDFzTOKONlJVbawM/edit?usp=drive_link">EXPERT
							INTERVIEWS</a></i> where we asked senior consultants, teachers and institutional leaders on
					their thoughts on the relation between younger generations and career.</p>

				<h2></h2>
				<p><b>Among the interviewed subjects (university students and high schoolers), there is a typical
						uncertainty surrounding the choice of "profession".</b> There is a demand for a medium-term
					commitment
					(3-5 years) to a career choice, but in the absence of an adequate toolbox, most students plan for
					the short term (1-2 years). The strategy of choosing a university that broadly covers their
					interests, but without a concrete idea of where they want to "end up", was typical of the subjects.
					The choice of career path is perhaps more crystallized towards the end of university. Another
					typical strategy is to study "even further" as a problem-solving tool to answer the career choice.
					E.g.: after a bachelor's degree, to do a Master's degree or even to start a completely different
					bachelor's degree. The experience gained can thus be increased within the academy. Students may need
					support in choosing a career. The question remains whether information on available careers can
					sufficiently meet this need.</p>

							href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KVAxuqTeOMpqTkfMtZNjX9QI1gPPxhw7PTxQmY2fcSg/edit?usp=sharing">USER
							INTERVIEWS</a></i> where we asked 11 aspiring career starter to tell us their problems,
					wishes and thoughts on the matter.</p>

				<h2>Pretotyping </h2>
				<p>Again we followed the classic double diamond model, but with an agile twist. We research, analyze,
					create and validate not just on a macro level but on a micro level too. At this point it became
					obvious that our problem was real. And so we built a pretotype to test our hypothesis: building a
					career planning solution could empower GenZ to make well-informed career choices.</p>

				<p>Check out our <i><a
							href="https://www.figma.com/proto/5eGASZat7L6T7sNebvcwrk/Prototype?page-id=864%3A446&node-id=864%3A1929&viewport=554%2C403%2C0.14&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=864%3A2051">PRETOTYPE_HU</a></i>
				</p>

				<p>We tested the pretotype with a handful of IT students and Levente - currently doing his masters in
					computer science - liked the idea (the problem) so much that he joined us on board as our developer.
				</p>

				<h1>ANALYZE</h1>
				<p>Since we had a clear goal in mind: build a career planning solution, we knew the users we wanted to
					serve: gen Z. And since we had a rich foundation of qualitative research data we jumped headstraight
					into analyzing. As an end result we hypothetised a possible user journey and finally formed our
					persona.</p>

				<h2>Affinity mapping</h2>
				<p>Against our secondary research almost all af the interviewed users (9 out of 12) said that purpose in
					their career is more important than money. Which was a huge surprise for us, but nevertheless an
					important piece of the puzzle and a good sign, that career does matter to gen Z.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/affinity_mapping.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Insights from interviews</h2>
				<p>Another important part were a general set of bad experiences throughout early schooling up until the
					university (for some even then) which resulted in bad faith for the institutions but more
					importantly that resulted in short term strategy where users plan for 1-2 years ahead and some even
					try to postpone serious decisions as much as they could. An example below:</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/insight1.png" alt="" /></div>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/insight2.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Behavioural variables</h2>
				<p>But it became truly clear through the behavioural variables who our typical user...</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/behavioural_variable.png" alt="" />

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<p>And so our persona was born. </p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/persona.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h1>CREATE</h1>
				<p>In this phase we were focused on creating a wireframe. We followed again a slightly unusual formula
					and fine tuned our design system as part of the UX (not UI) process. This was meant to make it much
					much more easy to create the UI but also at a later stage (which is not part of this case study's
					scope) to enable us to design straight at a high-level.</p>

				<h2>Collecting best practices</h2>
				<p>Two of our key competitors (in the US market) were the US Onet and CareerExplorer. We closely
					examined the two, by mapping their information architecture and testing the tests they offer. It
					became clear that combining the best of both plus creating a superb UX will be our competitive
					advantage.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/best_practice.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Site map</h2>
				<p>Low and behold our sitemap. Which is useful for later on in the development process but also for us,
					to see user rights at a glance.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/careeverze/site_map.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Design System</h2>
				<p>I have made a huge mistake here and paid the price for it (in many many hours of extra work).
					Initially we used an old design system template of mine and since Figma (our design tool) has
					changed and updated so much that caused more headache later on to replace that than it should
					have... Anyways we used Material 3 design system and adapted to our advantage as well as created
					some of the components we needed from scratch. Because I don't want to overwhelm you, let's just
					discuss one of the key pieces.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/job_point.png" alt="" />

				<p>First being the job mini card. This can enable the user at a glance to gather important pieces of
					information. Like a short description, the most fitting personality, general outlooks and
					requirements. This went through quite a lot of iterations till we got to this point. The main
					inspiration behind it was the push notifs in iOS. One question remains with this but (actually a
					couple but nevermind) let's speak about that in the prototype part.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/job_rate_card.png" alt="" />

				<p>Another key piece is the job rate card. Hopefully this does not require any additional information.
					You just rate the given job on a likert scale. This is also hugely important because the user rates
					quite a lot of jobs throughout the assessment phase. One thing to mention though, I am still unsure
					how we should spice up the background in a scaleable manner?</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/holland_hexagon.png" alt="" />

				<p>And least but not last the holland hexagon. This is the backbone of the assessment and job
					allocation. Based on the unique holland personality we can fit users to matching jobs.</p>

				<h2>Wireframing</h2>
				<p>And so our journey began and we started wireframing the screens. We went through 7 versions till we
					got the final part. From a low fidelity all the way to medium to high one. At the end of every
					distinct version we design critique-d the end results and iterated accordingly. Basically we got
					ourselves 5 distinct parts: onboarding, careeverse, explore, assessment and analyze. Also there is a
					free and a premium version (freemium) and so some of the parts have separate screens for each one.
					Below you may find the individual job point (explore - premium) screens. Because there is loads of
					information concerning every single job point, this is divided into three parts: overview, work
					context and preparation.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/wireframe1.png" alt="" />

				<p>Another key piece is the landing page. Which serves two purpose: a navigational main-point for free
					users and selling the premium features.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/wireframe2.png" alt="" />

				<p>I feel like there is also a hidden key piece which could result in a lot of user churn and that is
					the payment-sign up part. I shamelessly admit we copied almost everything from one of the major
					players: spotify.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/wireframe3.png" alt="" />

				<h1>VALIDATE</h1>
				<p>At this stage it was ripe time to test our hypothesis, now with a real prototype.</p>

				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<p>But before we could test our proto, we needed to breathe some life into them because most users would
					be shocked to use a designless thing. Therefore just for the sake of testing (this is not the final
					design) we gave it some design.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/prototyping.png" alt="" />

				<p>Because a screen can tell more than a thousand words please check out our prototype. But before you
					do that a couple of notes here. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer, so anything you
					feel is important and noteworthy! So if we meet in person and you check out the proto I would be
					very curious to hear your thoughts! With that being said, a couple more things to highlight (I'll
					keep it short I promise). Everything which is faded out is not available. If you click on the screen
					the interaction points will be highlighted. You may use the header navigation to go through the app.
					In the assessment part I saved you the time and you don't have to answer all the 100 questions so
					after three you will be redirected to the next stage. Please enjoy yourself!</p>

				<p><i><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/EObLFuDJf7Jepf64KOhYoY/Karrierd%C5%91-Proto?page-id=32630%3A96169&type=design&node-id=32630-99535&viewport=1308%2C2127%2C0.15&t=KPrj3umNo66CHtGN-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=32630%3A99535&mode=design">PROTOTYPE
							LINK</a></i></p>

				<p>A key interaction at this point is the swipe favorite and not interested features (still hesitant if
					these should be called that, and not like and dislike). This enables the user to swiftly collect
					noteworthy jobs at high speed.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/prototyping2.png" alt="" />

				<h2>Usability testing</h2>
				<p>And so we tested the prototype with 5 users from 3 distinct countries. This allowed us to get
					unbiased feedback. The key takeaways were two things. One macro two micro (okay that's three but
					nevermind). On a macro level based on the feedback it became clear that the two screens had an
					outsized impact on the user's feel. Guess which two they were? Yess you have guessed it right the
					landing page(s) and the individual job point. Users gave an outsized number of feedback here.</p>

				<img id="center" src="images/careeverze/usability_testing.png" alt="" />

				<p>On micro level the main two takeaway were that the value proposition of the app is not clear at first
					glance (what should I do with the app and why?). And also that users need much more stimulus and
					less information because dry facts can overwhelm there senses very easily.</p>

				<p>And now coming to an end, I hope this was just as useful and fun for you as for me. I sure as hell
					learned so much and am now quite excited to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to reach out to me
					on socials if anything comes to your mind.</p>
