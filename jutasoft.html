				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Redesigning a classic DOS desktop experience created for shop inventory management. My goal was to
					remaster the app by giving it a fresh new style, a modern UI kit, and an improved main flow.
				</p>

				<h2>Inspiration</h2>
				<p>Once upon a time, I visited a shop nearby, and I was captivated by the DOS program they used for
					inventory management. Despite its minimal design, it had a distinctive style that instantly
					transported me back to long-forgotten memories of sitting in front of my grandpa's old computer,
					playing some of the best games I have ever experienced, with such few pixels that I still wonder how
					it even worked. Inspired by this nostalgic experience, I have made the decision to pay tribute to
					this old-fashioned program by infusing it with a fresh style and a renewed sense of nostalgia.
				</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/juta_soft_screen.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Styles</h2>
				<p> I knew for sure that the heart of this application lies in its simplicity and usability. I wanted to
					honor that essence and focus on refining the details rather than making drastic changes.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>So first things first, one of the most distinctive features is the classic navy blue background. I
					knew for sure that I wanted to alleviate the eye strain caused by the sharp blue background and make
					it slightly more subtle. Therefore, I decided to go with a micro-patterned infinite background.
					Initially, I thought of incorporating a carbon texture (first line) bacause it’s durable and
					lightweight, much like this software. However, it felt too modern for the intended style. Then, I
					experimented with gray materials (second line), but it ended up losing its original flair and
					becoming dull. Finally, I realized that I needed to preserve the nostalgic blue feeling. The
					Moroccan blue tiles (third line, first from the left) were magnificent as a background decoration,
					but they were not suitable for the higher purpose. The oriental pattern (third line, last from the
					left) had a visually striking effect similar to the old background, but I didn't want users to
					experience hallucinations after prolonged use. Eventually, I settled for a smoother blue shade in
					the middle. It was just perfect — a sharp, deep blue that wasn't too intense. Moreover, the subtle
					circles added a nice touch to the overall design, balancing the sharp edges of the components."

				<h2>Colors</h2>
				<p> Once again, I recognized that the magic of this app lies precisely in its simplicity. It's like a
					refreshing breeze in a world filled with complexity, where apps go for the fifty shades of grey.
				</p>

				<p> For the primary color, I have picked the old blue but made it slightly clearer and lighter.</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/colors1.png" alt="" /></span>

				<p>As for the neutral colors, I reintroduced shades of this particular blue.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/colors4.png" alt="" /></span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<br>

				<p> For the system colors, I utilized Khroma's AI solution to generate complementary colors for my
					primary blue. I know I know this is a bit more magentaish then red... Well, you are right, BUT this
					color went so well with the blue that I allowed it to surpass the intended boundaries. I am sorry.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/colors5.png" alt="" /></span>

				<h2>Fonts</h2>
				<p> Obviously, I searched for the original font, but had no luck. There was no mention of it on the web,
					and my attempts at image-based searching yielded very few results. However, armed with my own eyes,
					I set out to find a similar font. This presented a marvelous opportunity to give the app a fresh
					look. Initially, I tried the 'Sora' font because it captured the unique design of the letter 'l'
					(imagine it like a number '1' with a perpendicular stem) reminiscent of the original font. However,
					during the first round of design critique (shout out to @frenipataki), I realized that Sora still
					conveyed a somewhat modern impression. Ultimately, I opted for 'IBM Plex Mono,' which added a
					delightful touch of flair. To maintain simplicity, I employed only three font styles for the header,
					body, and menu title.

				<h2>Shadows</h2>
				<p> Who on earth uses hard shadows these days?! Alright, alright, alright I do acknowledge that the
					recent brutalist or neubrutalist movement has brought them back to some extent. However, I must
					admit that I became rather excited to experiment with them and give these sharp objects even sharper
					edges. For the large grey containers, I utilized a subtle transparent shadow, while for the small
					blue menu containers, I employed a solid black one.</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/shadows.png" alt="" /></span>

				<h2>UI kit</h2>
				<p> The two key components of the UI kit are the large grey container and the small blue container.
					Therefore, I dedicated ample time to perfecting the details of these elements. Once those were in
					place, everything else seamlessly fell into line.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/juta_soft_screen.png" alt="" /></div>


				<h2>Large grey container</h2>
				<p> I was well aware that I wanted to preserve as much of the original product as possible, while also
					refining the details and giving it a modern touch. Through some research, I discovered that having
					two outer lines on the grey container was a standard practice in DOS programs. Although I was unsure
					of the exact reason, I decided to retain this line but simplify it to a single, clean outer line. I
					was tempted to round the corners (as it is generally a good design approach) or create a background
					resembling blurred glass (a prevailing trend), but both options would have resulted in a
					significantly different appearance. Ultimately, I aimed to embrace the DOS aesthetic side rather
					than transforming it into an iOS-like app. Thus, I kept much of it intact, preserving the outer line
					while utilizing the available space outside of it to display the name of the current menu.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/grey_container.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Small blue container</h2>
				<p>Now, moving on to the next iteration. I experimented with a few options here. First, I tried a
					state-of-the-art design with two lines (still no). Then, I attempted a modern, simple white outer
					edge, which looked quite unusual when combined with the hard shadow. However, none of these options
					were as suitable as the magical simplicity of a single line.</p>

				<p>But as opposed to her old counterparts the paddings are even, and the size is dependent on the
					content. It is also aligned in the center almost always.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/blue_container_final.png" alt="" /></div>

				<p>Generally speaking these were the rules of thumb for every single component in terms of padding, size
					and place.</p>

				<h2>An homage</h2>
				<p> The blinking red text at the beginning is an homage to one of my favorite DOS games, Keen Commander
					4. Its starting screen featured precisely that - blinking red text.</p>

				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/begin.png" alt="" /></div>
				<div class="image fit"><img src="images/juta_soft/keen_commander_begin.png" alt="" /></div>

				<h2>Copywriting</h2>
				<p> Terms like 'designation' are never-ever used these days. The question then arises, why not simplify
					and modernize the terminology? The truth is, the technical jargon is deeply ingrained in the
					program, and changing it would fundamentally alter its character. Therefore, I decided to leave it
					unchanged. The same applies to elements like capitalization (none), peculiar and esoteric features
					(e.g.: “call it a day”), and the overall logic. In a user-centric world, it becomes a fascinating
					case study to revisit products like this, where programs were predominantly created by and for
					engineers.</p>

				<h2>Flow</h2>
				<p>I have established the main user flow, which involves the user opening the program, setting up a
					profile, and registering and paying for a couple of items. An essential aspect of this experience
					was its efficiency. To achieve that, I reintroduced micro-interactions to ensure a smooth flow for a
					blunt instrument. I believe this paradox best captures the essence of the overall feeling.</p>
